The next time Nani casts a spell, discard 1 +damage token and that spell deals additional damage. Mina starts with 7 life. If Nani becomes exhausted, Mina gains 3 enraged tokens. At the start of Mina's turn, discard one Enrage token. Spells she casts that turn deal +2 damage. After this point, if Mina starts a turn with 0 Enrage tokens, the players lose.}}
