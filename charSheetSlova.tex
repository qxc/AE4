\notes{Slova's IV breach is the deferral breach. Spells cannot be prepped to this breach except by effects that directly refer to it. When a spell is cast from Slova's other breaches, destroy those spells instead of resolving their effect. At the end of Slova's casting phase, prep any spells destroyed this turn to Slova's IV \breach. When a spell is cast from Slova's IV breach, that spell deals 2 additional damage. Slova's IV breach cannot be destroyed. Any number of spells can be prepped to Slova's IV breach.}
