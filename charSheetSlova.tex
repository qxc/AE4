\notes{Slova's IV breach is the deferral breach. Spells cannot be prepped to this breach except by effects that directly refer to it. At the start of Slova's casting phase, cast each spell prepped to his IV breach. When a spell is cast from Slova's I/II/III breaches, prep those spells to the deferral breach instead of resolving their effect even if the deferral breach is closed. When a spell is cast from Slova's opened IV breach, that spell deals 2 additional damage. Slova's IV breach cannot be destroyed. Any number of spells can be prepped to Slova's IV breach.}
