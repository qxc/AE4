\notes{On the left side of the front of this mat, there is a barrier track. Place the barrier token on the "Ally draws a card." of the barrier track. \newline When Taqren suffers damage, move the barrier token to different space on the barrier track and resolve the listed effect. \newline While exhausted, if Taqren suffers damage, move the barrier token to a different space on the barrier track and resolve the listed effect. If Gravehold would suffer damage this way, it suffers 1 damage per 1 damage Taqren suffers instead of 2.}
