\notes{Dendra's II breach is the Flourishing breach. When a spell is cast from the flourishing breach, place a Dev token on the top card of any supply pile. While a card has a dev token on it, that card may be developed for half its cost, rounded up. This doesn't change existing development costs. When a card with dev tokens on it is gained, the player who gained that card gains 1 charge for each dev token on it after the first. Then, discard all dev tokens on that card.}
