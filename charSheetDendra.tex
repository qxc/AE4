\notes{Dendra's I breach is the Flourishing breach. When a spell is cast from the flourishing breach, place a Dev token on the top card of any supply pile. When a card has a Dev token on it, that card may be developed for half its cost, rounded up. Remove all Dev tokens from a card when it's gained. If a card is gained with more than 1 Dev token, each Dev token after the first gives the player who develops that card 1 charge.}
